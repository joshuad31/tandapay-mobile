# TandaPay Contract Address Configuration Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented user-configurable TandaPay contract addresses per network, allowing users to set their own community contract addresses instead of relying on developer-deployed contracts.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Redux State Management
- **Added contract addresses to settings state**: Extended `TandaPaySettingsState` to include per-network contract addresses
- **Updated action types**: Added `contractAddresses` to `TandaPaySettingsUpdateAction`
- **Added selectors**: New selectors for accessing contract addresses per network

### 2. Contract Address Configuration Component
- **Created `ContractAddressConfiguration.js`**: New component for users to configure contract addresses
- **Address input with QR scanner**: Uses existing `AddressInput` component with QR code scanning capability
- **Per-network configuration**: Shows current network and allows setting address for selected network
- **Form validation**: Validates Ethereum address format before saving
- **User-friendly interface**: Clear labels, descriptions, and save/clear buttons

### 3. Network Settings Integration
- **Added to TandaPayNetworkSettingsScreen**: Integrated contract address configuration into network settings
- **Disabled during network switching**: Prevents changes while network operations are in progress
- **Proper component ordering**: Placed logically between RPC configuration and performance settings

### 4. Contract Instance Management
- **New state-aware functions**: Added `createTandaPayContractWithSignerFromState` and `createTandaPayContractWithProviderFromState`
- **User-configured addresses**: Functions now use Redux state to get user-configured contract addresses
- **Backward compatibility**: Original functions still available for fallback scenarios
- **Enhanced error handling**: Clear error messages when contract addresses aren't configured

### 5. Transaction System Integration
- **Updated TransactionModal**: Now uses state-aware contract creation functions
- **Proper dependency management**: Fixed React hooks dependencies
- **Error messaging**: Clear feedback when contract addresses need to be configured

## Code Structure

### Redux Integration
```javascript
// State type (settingsReducer.js)
contractAddresses: {|
  mainnet: ?string,
  sepolia: ?string,
  arbitrum: ?string,
  polygon: ?string,
  custom: ?string,
|}

// Selectors (selectors.js)
getTandaPayContractAddressForNetwork(state, network)
getCurrentTandaPayContractAddress(state)
```

### Component Usage
```javascript
// Network Settings Screen
<ContractAddressConfiguration
  disabled={Boolean(switchingNetwork)}
/>
```

### Contract Creation
```javascript
// State-aware contract creation
const contractResult = await createTandaPayContractWithSignerFromState(
  selectedNetwork, 
  reduxState
);
```

## User Experience

### Configuration Flow
1. **Navigate to Network Settings**: User goes to TandaPay network settings
2. **Select Network**: Choose the network for contract configuration
3. **Enter Contract Address**: Use text input or QR scanner to enter contract address
4. **Validate and Save**: System validates address format and saves to Redux state
5. **Use in Transactions**: Contract address is automatically used for all TandaPay operations

### Error Handling
- **Missing Address**: Clear message when contract address not configured
- **Invalid Format**: Real-time validation of Ethereum address format
- **Network Switching**: Prevents configuration during network operations
- **Transaction Failures**: Helpful guidance to configure addresses when needed

## Technical Benefits

### Flexibility
- **Community-specific contracts**: Each community can deploy and use their own contracts
- **Multi-network support**: Different contract addresses per network
- **Easy updates**: Users can change contract addresses as needed

### Developer Benefits
- **No deployment requirement**: Developers don't need to deploy contracts
- **Easier testing**: Developers can use test contracts easily
- **Community independence**: Communities manage their own contract deployments

### User Benefits
- **Self-service configuration**: Users control their contract addresses
- **QR code support**: Easy address entry via QR scanning
- **Clear validation**: Immediate feedback on address validity
- **Network awareness**: Automatic handling of different networks

## Configuration Requirements

To use this feature:

1. **Deploy TandaPay contract** on desired network
2. **Navigate to Network Settings** in the app
3. **Select target network** from network selector
4. **Enter contract address** in the Contract Address Configuration section
5. **Save configuration** and start using TandaPay features

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/tandapay/components/ContractAddressConfiguration.js` - Main configuration component

### Modified Files
- `src/tandapay/redux/reducers/settingsReducer.js` - Added contract addresses to state
- `src/tandapay/redux/selectors.js` - Added contract address selectors
- `src/actionTypes.js` - Updated settings action type
- `src/tandapay/services/ContractInstanceManager.js` - Added state-aware functions
- `src/tandapay/components/TransactionModal.js` - Updated to use state-aware functions
- `src/tandapay/TandaPayNetworkSettingsScreen.js` - Added configuration component
- `src/tandapay/components/index.js` - Exported new component

The implementation provides a complete solution for user-configurable TandaPay contract addresses while maintaining backward compatibility and providing excellent user experience.
