# Transaction Revert Detection Fix

## Issue Fixed
The error handler was incorrectly showing the fallback message "Smart contract operation failed. This may be due to network congestion or insufficient gas." for transactions that would revert, instead of explicitly stating "Transaction would revert".

## Root Cause
The error detection logic in `ErrorHandler.js` was structured incorrectly:
1. It checked for gas estimation patterns broadly
2. Then checked for insufficient funds within that broad category
3. Then checked for UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT (revert indicator)
4. **But fell through to the generic gas estimation message**

## Solution
Reorganized the error detection logic to prioritize revert detection:

### Before (Incorrect Priority)
```javascript
if (gas estimation patterns) {
  if (insufficient funds) return "insufficient funds message";
  if (UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT) return "revert message";
  return "generic gas estimation failed"; // ❌ This was being reached for reverts
}
```

### After (Correct Priority)
```javascript
if (gas estimation patterns) {
  // FIRST: Check for reverts
  if (UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT || execution reverted || revert patterns) {
    return "Transaction would revert"; // ✅ Explicit revert message
  }
  
  // SECOND: Check for insufficient funds
  if (insufficient funds patterns) {
    return "insufficient funds message";
  }
  
  // THIRD: Fallback for true gas estimation issues
  return "Smart contract operation failed..."; // ✅ Only for network/gas issues
}
```

## Enhanced Revert Detection
Added more comprehensive revert pattern detection:
- `UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT` (ethers.js error code)
- `execution reverted`
- `revert`
- `always failing transaction`
- `transaction may fail`
- `call revert exception`
- `VM Exception while processing transaction`
- `transaction reverted`

## Results

### User Experience
- **Revert scenarios**: Clear "Transaction would revert" message
- **Network issues**: Appropriate "Smart contract operation failed" fallback
- **Copy Error button**: Provides full technical details including original ethers.js error

### Technical Details
- Updated tests to reflect improved behavior
- All 68 error handling tests passing
- Preserved backward compatibility for all other error types
- Enhanced copy functionality includes original error for debugging

## Error Flow Examples

### Transaction Revert
```
User sees: "Gas Estimation Failed: Transaction would revert"
Copy Error provides: 
"Gas Estimation Failed: Transaction would revert

Technical Details:
Error: cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit (error="execution reverted: AlreadyPaid", method="estimateGas", transaction={"from":"0x...","to":"0x...","data":"0x..."}, code=UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT, version=providers/5.7.2)"
```

### Network Issues
```
User sees: "Gas Estimation Failed: Smart contract operation failed. This may be due to network congestion or insufficient gas."
Copy Error provides:
"Gas Estimation Failed: Smart contract operation failed...

Technical Details:
Error: gas required exceeds allowance (gasLimit: 21000)"
```

This fix ensures that:
1. ✅ Contract reverts are explicitly identified as reverts
2. ✅ The fallback message is only used for true network/infrastructure issues
3. ✅ Developers get full technical details via "Copy Error"
4. ✅ All existing functionality is preserved
