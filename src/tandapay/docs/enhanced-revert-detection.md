# Enhanced Revert Detection and Error Messaging

## Problem Addressed

The user was getting a generic error message: "Gas Estimation Failed: Smart contract operation failed. This may be due to network congestion or insufficient gas." when trying to send a transaction that should revert, instead of getting an explicit message that the transaction would revert.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Simulation Functions** (`writeTransactionObjects.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
const executionResult = await TandaPayErrorHandler.withErrorHandling(
  () => contract.callStatic.someMethod(...args),
  'CONTRACT_ERROR'
);
// Used generic error handling that gave generic messages
```

**After:**
```javascript
try {
  const callResult = await contract.callStatic.someMethod(...args);
  return { success: true, result: callResult, error: null };
} catch (error) {
  const parsedError = TandaPayErrorHandler.parseEthersError(error);
  let errorMessage = parsedError.userMessage;
  
  // Be explicit about reverts for generic contract errors
  if (parsedError.type === 'CONTRACT_ERROR'
      && (errorMessage.includes('Smart contract operation failed')
          || errorMessage.includes('execution reverted')
          || errorMessage.includes('transaction may fail'))) {
    errorMessage = `Transaction would revert: ${parsedError.userMessage}`;
  }
  
  return { success: false, result: null, error: errorMessage };
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handler** (`ErrorHandler.js`)

Added specific handling for revert patterns:

```javascript
// Contract revert errors (catch common revert patterns)
if (errorMessage.includes('revert')
    || errorMessage.includes('execution reverted')
    || errorMessage.includes('transaction failed')) {
  return {
    message: 'Transaction would revert',
    userMessage: 'This transaction cannot be completed at this time. The contract state may not allow this operation right now.',
    type: 'CONTRACT_ERROR'
  };
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Transaction Modal** (`TransactionModal.js`)

Made simulation failure messages more explicit:

```javascript
if (!simulationResult.success) {
  // If simulation fails, the transaction would revert - be explicit about this
  let errorMessage = simulationResult.error;
  if (errorMessage && !errorMessage.includes('Transaction would revert')) {
    errorMessage = `Transaction would revert: ${errorMessage}`;
  }
  return {
    success: false,
    error: errorMessage || 'Transaction would revert - this operation is not valid at this time',
  };
}
```

## Error Message Flow

### For Specific Contract Errors:
1. **Simulation fails** with specific error (e.g., "PremiumAlreadyPaid")
2. **TandaPay error parser** catches it → "Premium has already been paid for this period."
3. **Simulation function** returns the specific message
4. **User sees**: "Premium has already been paid for this period."

### For Generic Revert Errors:
1. **Simulation fails** with generic error (e.g., "execution reverted")
2. **Error handler** catches revert pattern → "This transaction cannot be completed at this time..."
3. **Simulation function** detects generic contract error → prepends "Transaction would revert: "
4. **User sees**: "Transaction would revert: This transaction cannot be completed at this time. The contract state may not allow this operation right now."

### For Unknown/Network Errors:
1. **Simulation fails** with network/other error
2. **Error handler** falls back to generic handling
3. **User sees**: Generic error message as fallback

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Now when a transaction would revert:
- User clicks "Estimate Gas"
- Simulation detects the revert
- User sees explicit message: "Transaction would revert: [specific reason]"
- OR for TandaPay-specific errors: "[Specific user-friendly message]"

### ✅ Fallback error is only shown for:
- Network connectivity issues  
- RPC provider problems
- Genuine unexpected errors

## Testing

To test the improvements, try transactions that should revert:

1. **Premium already paid** → "Premium has already been paid for this period."
2. **Not secretary trying secretary action** → "This action can only be performed by the secretary."
3. **Generic revert** → "Transaction would revert: This transaction cannot be completed..."
4. **Network issue** → "Smart contract operation failed..." (fallback)

The system now clearly distinguishes between:
- ✅ **Revert situations** (explicit "would revert" messaging)
- ✅ **Network/infrastructure issues** (fallback generic messaging)
- ✅ **Specific contract state issues** (user-friendly specific messages)

## Files Modified

1. **`src/tandapay/contract/writeTransactionObjects.js`**
   - Enhanced `createSimulation()` function
   - Updated individual simulation functions
   - Added explicit revert detection

2. **`src/tandapay/errors/ErrorHandler.js`**
   - Added revert pattern detection
   - Enhanced error message prioritization

3. **`src/tandapay/components/TransactionModal.js`**
   - Made simulation failure messages more explicit
   - Ensured "Transaction would revert" appears in error messages

The error messaging is now much more explicit about transaction reverts vs other types of failures!
