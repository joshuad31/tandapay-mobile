/**
 * MACRO INTEGRATION SUMMARY
 *
 * This file documents the completed macro integration preparation for address array
 * parameters, specifically the "Define Secretary Successor List" transaction.
 *
 * CHANGES MADE:
 *
 * 1. AddressArrayInput Component (src/tandapay/components/AddressArrayInput.js):
 *    - Added configurable `maxAddresses` prop (default: ExpectedSuccessorCounts.communityLargerThan35)
 *    - Replaced hardcoded limit of 10 with dynamic constant-based default
 *    - Component is now macro-ready and backward compatible
 *
 * 2. TransactionParameterForm Component (src/tandapay/components/TransactionParameterForm.js):
 *    - Enhanced address[] parameter handling with macro integration support
 *    - Added two methods for macros to configure address limits:
 *      a) Via prefilledParams.maxAddresses (preferred method)
 *      b) Via displayName suffix parsing (fallback method)
 *    - Added comprehensive documentation for macro developers
 *    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing transactions
 *
 * 3. Constants Integration (src/tandapay/contract/constants.js):
 *    - ExpectedSuccessorCounts.communityLargerThan35 is now the default limit
 *    - Provides getExpectedSuccessorCount() function for dynamic calculation
 *
 * 4. Documentation (src/tandapay/contract/macros/MACRO_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md):
 *    - Added Pattern 3: Address Array Configuration
 *    - Added complete example: Secretary Successor Macro
 *    - Shows both prefilledParams and displayName methods
 *    - Provides ready-to-use code templates
 *
 * MACRO INTEGRATION PATTERNS:
 *
 * Method 1 - Via prefilledParams (Recommended):
 * ```javascript
 * const transaction = {
 *   ...baseTransaction,
 *   prefilledParams: {
 *     maxAddresses: dynamicCount, // Controls address array limit
 *     // Can also pre-fill known addresses:
 *     successorListWalletAddresses: knownAddresses || [],
 *   },
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * Method 2 - Via displayName (Fallback):
 * ```javascript
 * const transaction = {
 *   ...baseTransaction,
 *   displayName: `Define Secretary Successor List (${count} addresses)`,
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * CURRENT STATE:
 *
 * âœ… AddressArrayInput supports configurable limits
 * âœ… TransactionParameterForm handles macro overrides
 * âœ… Constants are properly imported and used
 * âœ… Flow type checking passes
 * âœ… Documentation is complete
 * âœ… Backward compatibility maintained
 *
 * READY FOR:
 *
 * ðŸš€ Macro creation using address array configuration
 * ðŸš€ Dynamic successor count based on community size
 * ðŸš€ Integration with MacroWorkflow component
 * ðŸš€ Testing with different community sizes
 *
 * NEXT STEPS FOR MACRO DEVELOPERS:
 *
 * 1. Create a macro hook following the useSecretarySuccessorMacro example
 * 2. Implement the adapter following the secretarySuccessorMacroAdapter example
 * 3. Integrate with TandaPayActionsScreen using the documented pattern
 * 4. Test with different community sizes to verify dynamic limits
 *
 * The system is now fully prepared for macro integration with configurable
 * address array limits and maintains all existing functionality.
